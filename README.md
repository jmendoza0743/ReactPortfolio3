# React Portfolio
We were tasked with updating a responsive portfolio in React that we created earlier in the course.  Used the Bootstrap starter template and  worked off of that. Added in HTML elements and linked a CSS. Made components.  

## Purpose
We have updated our portfolios to show the projects that we have worked on. Also added links for GitHub, LinkedIn and our Resume. I have also created a page that has my contact information. 

## Technologies
Used HTML and CSS, Bootstrap Javascript and React to create a responsive portfolio that changes depending on the device that is being used to view it.

## Credits
This was compiled using a variety of sources including class notes and powerpoints, assistance from the TAs and instructor and websites like W3Schools.com. Also used the Bootstrap for items like cards and nav bar. Google fonts were also used for the header. The project was based off of react.
